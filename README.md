## Tech Stack Evolution

This project started as a JavaScript-based Node.js backend.

As the codebase grew, TypeScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
were gradually introduced for complex domains such as:
- Result computation
- Grading configuration
- Business rule enforcement

The project currently supports both JavaScript and TypeScript modules.
This allows backward compatibility while improving long-term maintainability.
